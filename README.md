Hi there!

This was a semester long project for my CSC Senior Seminar class.
We explored the use of react components and gatsby for developing web based applications.
This began with the simple tutorial pages and eventually evolved into the web based pokedex seen here.

Use of the Pokedex is simple: At the top is a simple text submission form. In this form you can submit the name or pokedex number of any pokemon.
Once entered the website will display the name, type, and stats of the pokemon alongside an image and some simple descriptive information like weight.
